to my knowledge, everyone here has just completed a python course, and is about to go into iti1121, where you will be learning java

i would like to point out that the final class average was a 57%, and i finished with a 98, so i'm able to get a pretty good idea of what everyone needs to know to succeed.

as such, i've made a mini java course that will equip everyone here with the fundamentals you need that will allow you to focus on the course content instead of stumbling over basics.

with that, lets take a look at the agenda.

i suspect that the use most of you will get from this session is just me explaining all the differences in syntax and thought process behind python and java

for example, you now have to worry about variable declaration, and you can't print an array by just putting it in a print statement anymore. i'll explain everything in time.

but, my ultimate goal here is to have everyone be able to do lab 1 from last year with ease, because after reviewing my code for this course, lab 1 is a pretty good filter to check which students understand the fundamentals, and which students do not. if you struggle with lab one, keeping up is just going to be a complete lost cause.

as such, ive based my session around lab 1, and every subject i cover today will have relevance to it.

however, i don't want to get smote for academic integrity since i'm only in my second year, so i've created my own set of questions based on the lab that will cover the same concepts but more elegantly.

also, i've designed these questions to consolidate fundamentals more than challenge your ability to problem solve, so you can really focus on just nailing the syntax.
