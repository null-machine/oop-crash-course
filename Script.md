to my knowledge, everyone here has just completed a python course, and is about to go into iti1121, where you will be learning java
from what i can remember from last year, this transition was so dramatic that the final class average was a 57%.
this is the class that determines whether you drop out or not.
however, i finished with a 98%, so my goal for today is to prepare each and every one of you with what i believe to be a solid set of fundamentals that will allow you to focus on the course content instead of stumbling over basics.

with that, lets take a look at the agenda.
