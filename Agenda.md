# Introduction to Java
- This session will cover the fundamentals of Java before OOP (Object-Oriented Programming)
- If you're comfortable with OOP, this session will likely be beneath you
- Resources for this session will also function as a syntax reference to make the transition from Python easier
- By the end, everyone will be able to comfortably do Lab 1 from last year's ITI1121

# Crash Course Breakdown
1. Variables
2. Input
- Q1) Write a program that gets three integers from the user and calculates their average as a double.
3. Conditionals
4. Loops
- Q2) Write a program that checks if a number given by the user is prime.
5. Arrays
- Q3) Write a program that constructs and prints a 10 by 10 array with each element equal to the product of its indices.
6. Functions
- Q4) Write a function that takes an array, a value, and an index that returns a new array with the value inserted at the index specified.

# Bonus Time
- How to read an API with the String class
- Explaining what `static` is and why it's showing up everywhere
- Setting up Java and JUnit (I'm assuming the profs have this covered)
- Code review (send me some code you've written and I'll see if I can catch any pitfalls or potential mark losses)
